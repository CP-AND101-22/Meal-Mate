## App Overview

### Description 

Meal Mate allows users to search for recipes based on a leftover ingredient that's about to expire!

### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Food
- **Mobile:** The mobile experience would enable users to quickly access recipes, and potentially upload images of their fridge to get recipe recommendations.
- **Story:** Would prevent food wastage, help chaotic meal preppers, and facilitate spontaneous meals with existed ingredients.
- **Market:** Anyone who has a fridge or pantry, and a willingness to make or prepare a meal. Could be monetized with ingredient brand partnerships that advertise their recommended recipes on the platform.
- **Habit:** Users would open the app whenever they open their fridge and face decision fatigue on what to make with what's there.
- **Scope:** V1 would allow users to search recipes by ingredient. V2 allow searching recipes with multiple ingredients factored in. V3 would add an image recognition feature in which the user simply uploads a picture of their fridge for recipe recommendations.
